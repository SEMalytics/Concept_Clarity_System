# Concept Clarity Quick Reference

## The Core Pattern

```
UNDERSTAND → ANALYZE → SCORE → SPECIFY → RECOMMEND
```

Every positioning clarity assessment. No exceptions.

---

## Agent Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Navigator** | Document upload | Identify types → Determine depth → Route to assessment |
| **Assessment** | Documents routed | Extract concepts → Map divergences → Analyze dimensions |
| **Scoring** | Assessment complete | Aggregate scores → Rank divergences → Generate report |

---

## Scoring Quick Reference

| Dimension | Range | What It Measures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Consistency** | 0-33 | Do materials emphasize same core concepts? |
| **Focus** | 0-33 | Is messaging concentrated or fragmented? |
| **Alignment** | 0-34 | Do materials support same strategic positioning? |
| **Overall** | 0-100 | Sum of all dimensions |

### Score Interpretation

```
90-100: Exceptional → Minor refinements only
75-89:  Strong → Address specific divergences
60-74:  Moderate → Systematic alignment needed
45-59:  Weak → Major inconsistencies present
0-44:   Critical → Comprehensive overhaul required
```

---

## Divergence Types

| Type | What It Is | Impact Level |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Contradiction** | Documents explicitly contradict | High |
| **Emphasis Mismatch** | Same concept, different importance | Medium |
| **Framing Inconsistency** | Same concept, different positioning | Medium |
| **Omission Pattern** | Present in some, absent in others | Variable |
| **Audience Confusion** | Different target segments | High |

---

## Assessment Workflow

```
1. EXTRACT
   └── Core concepts from each document

2. COMPARE
   └── Shared themes vs. divergences

3. ANALYZE
   ├── Consistency score
   ├── Focus score  
   └── Alignment score

4. PRIORITIZE
   └── Top 3-5 divergences by impact

5. REPORT
   └── Scores + evidence + recommendations
```

---

## Document Types

| Type | Signals | Analysis Focus |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Pitch Deck** | Slides, investor language | Strategic narrative, value props |
| **Website** | Homepage, product pages | Customer positioning, features |
| **Sales Materials** | One-pagers, battle cards | Competitive positioning, objections |
| **Marketing** | Case studies, whitepapers | Proof points, expertise claims |

---

## Evidence Standards

**Every divergence must include:**
- ✅ Specific quotes from documents
- ✅ Document name and location
- ✅ Clear inconsistency explanation
- ✅ Business impact assessment
- ✅ Actionable recommendation

**Never:**
- ❌ Cite without exact quotes
- ❌ Paraphrase evidence
- ❌ Make quality judgments
- ❌ Recommend strategy changes

---

## Fix Patterns

### Direct Contradiction
```
Issue: Docs explicitly contradict
Fix: Select canonical, update all
Example: "Best for enterprises" vs "Perfect for startups"
→ "Built for growing companies (50-500 employees)"
```

### Emphasis Mismatch
```
Issue: Same concept, different priority
Fix: Establish hierarchy, apply consistently
Example: Security primary in deck, tertiary on website
→ Security secondary everywhere (cost reduction primary)
```

### Framing Inconsistency
```
Issue: Same concept, different language
Fix: Align on single framing
Example: "AI-powered" vs "Machine learning enhanced"
→ Use "AI-powered" consistently
```

## Report Structure

```markdown
## Concept Clarity Score: XX/100

### Dimension Breakdown:
- Consistency: XX/33
- Focus: XX/33
- Alignment: XX/34

### Top Divergence Points:
1. [Name] (Impact: High/Medium/Low)
   - Issue: [What's wrong]
   - Evidence: [Quotes from docs]
   - Recommendation: [Specific fix]

### Strategic Implications:
[Business impact]

### Next Steps:
[Prioritized actions]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering analysis:
- [ ] All document types identified
- [ ] Concepts extracted from each document
- [ ] Top 3-5 divergences with evidence
- [ ] All three dimensions scored with justification
- [ ] Recommendations specific and actionable
- [ ] Strategic implications connect to business

---

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Early-Stage Drift**
```
Score: 60-75
Cause: Teams creating content independently
Fix: Establish positioning guide
Timeline: 1-2 quarters to align
```

**Pattern 2: Post-Pivot Inconsistency**
```
Score: 45-60
Cause: New strategy, old materials remain
Fix: Systematic content audit and update
Timeline: 2-3 quarters for full refresh
```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Product Confusion**
```
Score: 50-65
Cause: Multiple products without clear hierarchy
Fix: Product positioning framework
Timeline: 1 quarter planning, 2 quarters execution
```

## Decision Trees

### Analysis Depth

```
START: Documents uploaded

├── 1 document?
│   └── Quick scan → Suggest complementary materials
│
├── 2-3 documents?
│   └── Standard analysis → Full clarity scoring
│
├── 4+ documents?
│   └── Deep dive → Include trend analysis
│
└── Unclear intent?
    └── Ask one question → Route based on answer
```

### Divergence Priority

```
START: Divergence identified

├── Affects purchase decisions?
│   └── Impact: High
│
├── Creates customer confusion?
│   └── Impact: High
│
├── Affects secondary messaging?
│   └── Impact: Medium
│
├── Minor wording variation?
│   └── Impact: Low
│
└── Platform-specific adaptation?
    └── Impact: Low (acceptable)
```

## Quick Wins vs. Strategic Fixes

**Quick Wins** (Days to weeks):
- Update specific contradicting statements
- Align primary value proposition wording
- Fix obvious omissions in key materials
- Standardize proof points across materials

**Strategic Fixes** (Months):
- Comprehensive content audit
- Positioning guide development
- Team training and enablement
- Content governance process
- Quarterly measurement tracking

---

## When to Re-Assess

**Triggers for re-assessment:**
- After fixing major divergences (3 months)
- After product launches (immediately)
- After strategic pivots (immediately)
- Quarterly (routine monitoring)
- Before major fundraising (2 weeks prior)
- After leadership changes (3 months)

## Integration Patterns

```
Navigator
   ↓
Assessment Engine
   ↓
Scoring Coordinator
   ↓
User Report
```

**Sequential flow**: Each completes before next begins
**Context preservation**: All relevant context carries through
**Evidence integrity**: Quotes maintain source attribution

---

## Critical Reminders

- **Measure consistency, not quality** — Don't judge ideas
- **Evidence required** — Every claim needs specific quotes
- **Business impact** — Connect divergences to outcomes
- **Actionable recommendations** — User can implement without follow-up
- **No strategy advice** — Flag inconsistencies, let user decide direction

## Bottom Line

**Input:** Company positioning materials (2+ documents)

**Process:** Extract concepts → Detect divergences → Score dimensions

**Output:** Concept Clarity Score (0-100) + specific fixes with evidence

**Value:** Quantify positioning drift before it damages brand coherence

**Timeline:** Analysis in <10 minutes, fixes over 1-3 quarters depending on severity

---

## Next Steps

1. **Upload documents** → Navigator routes to appropriate analysis depth
2. **Receive score** → Understand where clarity stands today
3. **Review divergences** → See specific inconsistencies with evidence
4. **Prioritize fixes** → Focus on high-impact changes first
5. **Re-assess quarterly** → Track improvement and catch new drift early

The goal is simple: **Keep your positioning as clear on Day 365 as it was on Day 1.**
